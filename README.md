# Sentiment_Analysis_MLFLow_Prefect
# This is a project associated with Innomatics Research Labs,Hyderabad.
In this project we integrate our ML Pipeline of Sentiment Analysis to MLFLow and orchestrate the workflow using Prefect.
- Leveraged a dataset of 8,518 reviews for the "YONEX MAVIS 350 Nylon Shuttle" product and developed a sentiment analysis solution for Flipkart product reviews.
- Employed advanced data preprocessing techniques, including text cleaning, normalization, and numerical feature extraction.
- Implemented machine learning and deep learning models trained on embedded text data to classify sentiment, with F1-Score serving as the evaluation metric.
- Demonstrated model registration and management with MLflow, facilitating easy tracking and comparison of model versions, while also implementing a Prefect Workflow for automated scheduling and execution of sentiment analysis tasks.
- Deployed the trained sentiment classification model integrated with a Flask web application on an AWS EC2 instance, enabling real-time inference and user interaction.
